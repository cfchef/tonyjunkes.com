I'm a Software Engineer living in sunny South Florida and have been working in many areas of the web development for quite some time now. I enjoy working with new things and have taken a liking to tinkering with various JVM languages like CFML, Groovy &amp; Clojure; among others.

Other than programming, I've worn many hats across different fields as a Martial Arts Instructor & Culinarian in professional kitchens. In my free time, I'm an avid gamer on both console and PC. I also enjoy cooking often (it's my Zen); as well as a bit of a craft beer enthusiast.

To see what I'm up to, you can check out some of my opensource endeavors [over on GitHub](https://github.com/cfchef).
